I'm Elliot, a software engineer with an unusual journey. I got degrees in ancient Greek history/archaeology from Harvard and Princeton before I discovered that my real calling was software engineering. There were signs along the way, of course, including a few years I spent as a consultant specializing in implementing Workday's HRIS software.

In my spare time, you can catch me training for the NYCRUNS Brooklyn Marathon 🏃 &nbsp; and DJing on the radio at WPRB 🔈 &nbsp;.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-wilson-4897a81b9/), [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/elliot-wilson-dev), and at my laptop.
