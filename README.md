### Hi there, I'm Elliot! 👋

I'm a software engineer with an unusual journey: I have an academic background in ancient Greek history 🏛️  and archaeology 🗿 , and I've also spent time as a Workday Payroll implementation consultant 👨‍💼. I love challenging myself, which is why I've become skilled in JavaScript, the MERN stack, and Ruby on Rails. I'm a full-stack developer who is just as energized by building RESTful APIs as I am by improving UI/UX through responsive design.

In my spare time, you can catch me training for the NYCRUNS Brooklyn Marathon and DJing on the radio at WPRB.
