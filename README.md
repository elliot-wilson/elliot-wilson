### Hi there, I'm Elliot! 👋

I'm a software engineer who's skilled in JavaScript, React, Redux, MongoDB, and Ruby on Rails 💻 &nbsp;

I've been on an unusual journey: I have an academic background in ancient Greek history 🏛️ &nbsp; and archaeology ⛏️&nbsp;, and I've also spent time as a Workday Payroll implementation consultant 👨‍💼 &nbsp;

Now, I'm a full-stack developer who is just as energized by building RESTful APIs as I am by improving UI/UX through responsive design 👨‍💻 &nbsp;


Current projects:
* [Wide World](https://github.com/elliot-wilson/WideWorld)
    * single-page clone of [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/) built with Ruby on Rails, React/Redux, and the Google Maps API 🧭 &nbsp;
* [Poly-Glot](https://github.com/elliot-wilson/poly-glot)
    * Vanilla JavaScript site that generates word puzzles inspired by the New York Time's [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) 🐝 &nbsp;
* [Beat Match](https://github.com/FarzamA/BeatMatch)
    * Spotify playlist-generator that uses MongoDB, Express.js, React/Redux, and Node.js 🎵 &nbsp;

In my spare time, you can catch me training for the NYCRUNS Brooklyn Marathon 🏃 &nbsp; and DJing on the radio at WPRB 🔈 &nbsp;.
